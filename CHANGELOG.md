## Fixed Issue: Food Items Not Appearing in Recently Logged View

### Summary of Changes
The following changes have been made to fix issues with both individual food items and combined food items not appearing immediately in the "Recently Logged" view until after app restart:

### 1. Improved RecentlyLoggedView.swift:
- Added setup of notification observers as soon as the view appears
- Added more comprehensive notification observers to respond to different types of updates
- Added a specific observer for "NewFoodItemAdded" notifications
- Enhanced the forceRefreshAllFoodData method with additional refresh cycles
- Added scheduled refreshes to ensure data is fully loaded

### 2. Enhanced FoodRecognitionManager.swift:
- Added explicit direct addition of individual food items to UserDefaults foodHistory
- Added specific "NewFoodItemAdded" notification for each newly added food item
- Added multiple synchronized notification posts to ensure UI updates
- Improved synchronization with UserDefaults.synchronize() calls
- Added explicit flags in UserDefaults to mark new food additions

### 3. Improved CombinedFoodManager.swift:
- Added new UserDefaults flags for immediate combined food detection
- Added "NewFoodItemAdded" notification when a combined food is created
- Enhanced notification timing to ensure UI updates properly

These changes work together to ensure proper data synchronization and immediate UI updates when food items are added to the app. The key improvements focus on:

1. Ensuring proper data storage in both CoreData and UserDefaults
2. Using multiple notification mechanisms to trigger UI updates
3. Adding specific flags to mark newly added items
4. Implementing better synchronization to prevent data loss
5. Adding multiple refresh cycles at different times to ensure everything updates correctly
